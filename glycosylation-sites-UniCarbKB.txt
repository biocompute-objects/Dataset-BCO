  List of human [taxid:9606] proteins with information on glycosylation sites from UniCarbKB database [https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/42/D1/D215/1052197, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkt1128] 
  The file also includes GlyTouCan accessions and UniCarbKB structure ids for associated glycan structures.
 
Description Domain
  Keywords: protein, canonical, glycosylation, glycan
  
  Pipeline Steps:
    Step 1: The input file was retrieved directly from source was "cleaned" for further processing.
    Step 2: The glycosylation type (linkage type) was assigned using a python script [make-proteoform_glycosylation_sites_unicarbkb_glytoucan-csv-step2.py] based on motif label provided by the author. 
    Step 3: The UniProtKB protein accessions were mapped to canonical accessions and the final data was processed for quality check using a python script[make-proteoform_glycosylation_sites_unicarbkb_glytoucan-csv-step3.py]. Records which fall under one or more following criteria's were flagged and eliminated (eliminated records can be accessed using the log file through Output subdomain):
    a. If the protein accession is not included in UniProt protein list [UniProt Nov-2017 Release]
    b. If the amino acid position does not match to the amino acid on the associated position on fasta sequence [UniProt Nov-2017 Release]
    c. If the id (UnicarbKB structure id) is not present in input file.
    d. If the glycosylation type (linkage type) is not retrieved through step 2.
    e. If a serine or threonine is reported for an N-linked glycan structure. 
    f. If an asparagine is reported for an O-linked glycan structure.
    g. If the glycosylation type (linkage type) has both "N-linked;O-linked" assignment through step 2.
