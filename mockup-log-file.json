Mock up 1:
"algorithmic_error": {
	"Single glycan has both 'N-linked/O-linked' associations" : 65,
	"The protein accession is not included in the GlyGen-Protein Master list (UniProt-Nov 2018)" : 89,
	"Amino acid position does not match to the amino acid on the associated position on fasta sequence [UniProt Nov-2018 Release]": 67,	
	"UnicarbKB structure id is not present in input source file": 109,
	"The glycosylation type (linkage type) is not retrieved via pipeline step 2" : 0,
	"Serine or threonine is reported for an N-linked glycan structure." : 250,
	"An asparagine is reported for an O-linked glycan structure.": 109
}	
	
Con: It does not specify the log file name. for eg- The first constrain is from 1a.log and rest are from 2a.log

con: same as mock up 1.
